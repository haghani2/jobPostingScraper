# LinkedIn Scraper

LinkedIn is an extremely popular platform for job seekers, making it one of the best websites to gather data on the job market.

## Scraping Job Listings

To collect data using this scraper, clone this repository and download the proper [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and put the executable in the same directory as both linkedin.py and scrape.py. The python libraries needed for this program are numpy, pandas, selenium, and tqdm. A requirements.txt file is provided.

After downloading ChromeDriver and installing the dependencies, open the scrape.py file and change the URLs list to a list of the URLs you wish to scrape. Running `python scrape.py` will show a progress bar for each URL being scraped and a linkedin-job-data.csv file will eventually be outputted containing the scraped data.
